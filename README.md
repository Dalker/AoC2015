# AoC2015
Advent of Code 2015 in Kotlin, done at a slow pace in 2022

This is done together with a few friends and colleagues who want to use the AoC problems
to improve their coding proficiency. In my case, I am using these problems to practice
Kotlin while I learn it.

A remark on Kotlin for each "day":
* 01: `when()` control structure (or expression) is nice to have -- also appeared in python 3.10
* 02: *extensions functions* combine well with a "functional programming" style
* 03: *companion object* is Kotlin's way of grouping "constant" or "static" members of a class
* 04: single-line `fun` definitions with `=` and expression `if` may help with short, readable code
* 05: maybe extension functions should be scope-restricted to avoid accidental misuse?
* 06: during class inheritance, explicit use of the `override` keyword is mandatory
* 07: testing for `null` can be chained with "elvis operators"
